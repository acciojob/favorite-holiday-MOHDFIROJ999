	<h1>The summer holidays </h1>
	<br>
	<p>The summer holidays are my most favorite because it is the longest holiday that our school offers us.
</p>
<p> I get a break from waking up early in the morning and repeating the boring routine of getting ready for school, doing homework, etc.
</p>
	<p>During holidays, I wake up at my own will and follow my own schedule.
 </p>
	<p>I also get the opportunity to spend time with my grandparents the most during these holidays.
</p>
	<p>I visit my grandparentsâ€™ home village. It is a very beautiful and calm place.
